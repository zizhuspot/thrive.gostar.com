> In recent years, with the acceleration of globalization and the sustained growth of the domestic economy, Chinese tourists' willingness to travel abroad has been increasing. Thailand, as one of the major destinations for Chinese tourists' outbound travel, has further stimulated Chinese tourists' interest in traveling to Thailand with the introduction of its visa-free policy.

## The Appeal of Thailand's Visa Exemption

On September 13, the Thai cabinet announced a visa exemption policy for Chinese tourists, which would be valid for five months starting from September 25, 2023, until February 29, 2024. This policy allows Chinese tourists to enter Thailand without applying for a visa, as long as they hold a passport or a travel document. The maximum duration of stay is 30 days.

The announcement of the visa exemption policy immediately sparked a surge in interest in traveling to Thailand. Within half an hour of the news, searches for Thai tourist attractions on Ctrip, a popular travel platform, increased by 800%. Another travel company, Spring Airlines, reported that almost all of their tour packages for the period from September 28 to October 1 were sold out, and there were only a few remaining packages for the period from October 2 to 6.

Thailand has abundant cultural and natural tourism resources, with many holiday destinations offering scenic views comparable to Europe at a fraction of the cost of domestic travel. With its "high cost-performance ratio," Thailand has become one of the most popular destinations among Chinese tourists.

## The Impact of COVID-19 and Safety Concerns

However, the enthusiasm of Chinese tourists traveling to Thailand has waned in recent years due to multiple factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and consumer concerns about safety in Southeast Asia. Data shows that the number of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand in the first seven months of this year was only 1.83 million, equivalent to approximately 20% of the same period in 2019.

However, during the current Golden Week holiday, Thailand has not seen a massive influx of Chinese tourists. Some netizens have posted on social media, expressing that there are not many tourists in Thailand, and the waiting time for visa exemption entry is only a few minutes. One netizen who arrived in Koh Samui on the 30th of September even mentioned, "There are hardly any people here."

Can Thailand quickly regain its previous popularity in the tourism market with the introduction of the visa exemption policy during this Golden Week?

## Who is Still Going to Thailand?

The visa exemption policy for Chinese tourists, effective from September 25, has reignited the interest of many travelers in visiting Thailand. After the policy was announced, many tourists have added Thailand back to their list of travel options. Small Huang, who works in Shenyang, stated that she last visited Bangkok a few years ago and was impressed by the delicious food, interesting attractions, and affordable prices. With the visa exemption policy coinciding with the crowdedness of domestic tourist destinations during the National Day holiday, she decided to change her plans and travel to Thailand instead.

There are many consumers like Small Huang who are considering Thailand as their travel destination. Ctrip predicts that during the Golden Week and the fourth quarter of this year, there will be more Chinese tourists traveling to Thailand, making it a top choice for outbound travel during the National Day holiday. Data from Mafengwo, another travel platform, also shows that the visa exemption policy has prompted many travelers who had not made travel plans to consider Thailand.

Even some post-00s generation travelers have chosen Thailand as their first overseas destination. Shu Shu, a post-00s traveler, mentioned that she has already booked her flight tickets to Thailand for this Golden Week holiday. Being in her first year of work, she wanted to spend her hard-earned money on an affordable and hassle-free destination.

Meanwhile, some netizens have started sharing their "on-site reports" on social media after traveling to Thailand under the visa exemption policy. Shelby Day, a user on Xiaohongshu, a popular social platform, arrived in Thailand on September 25 and shared her experience: "We were on the first batch of flight FD597, arriving at 1:30 am. Many people were not sure about the visa exemption and prepared visa applications. We saw the blue queue area for Visa on Arrival as soon as we got off the plane. All we needed to do was queue with our tickets and passports. It only took 3-5 minutes per person, very efficient."

However, despite the visa exemption, some consumers still have concerns about the safety of traveling to Thailand. Weiwei, who works in Shanghai, expressed her worries, saying, "I can't understand the popularity of Thailand. I am a bit concerned about the safety of traveling alone, especially as a girl. I also don't want to join a tour group, so I have some reservations."

## Safety Concerns and the Impact on Tourism

Keywords like "rip-offs" and "scams" are often mentioned when discussing safety concerns in Thailand. In March of this year, several Weibo topics, including "#Chinese Reveals the Truth About Male Model Restaurants in Thailand" and "#Cancellation Trend in Thai Tourism Bookings," became popular and sparked discussions among netizens about the safety of traveling to Thailand.

Even during the May Day holiday earlier this year, Chinese tourists' interest in traveling to Thailand was significantly affected. Data shows that as of May 21, Thailand received a total of 9.78 million foreign tourists, including only 1.03 million Chinese tourists, which was far below the expected target. According to the President of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Sisdivachr Cheewarattanaporn, under normal circumstances, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Thailand during the same period would have reached 7 million.
Faced with the decline in tourist arrivals, the Thai government introduced the visa exemption policy for Chinese tourists just before the Golden Week holiday to attract their attention. So far, this strategy seems to be effective.

## The Tourism Industry in Thailand is Desperate for Recovery

"The past three years have made me want to give up," said Niu Niu, who runs a guesthouse in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
"At the beginning, I was very confident that things would quickly return to normal. I remember at the end of 2019, many people rushed to inspect the guesthouses here before the lockdown. At that time, everyone was full of confidence that everything would be back to normal in early 2020, and we would catch another wave of tourists."
However, Niu Niu did not expect the situation to last for three years. During this period, she had to do private dining, sell dumplings to Chinese people in Thailand, try her hand at social media, and even sell a guesthouse villa.

"My guesthouses in Chiang Mai are mostly detached villas, usually listed on Airbnb for families of four. Because they are not large-scale guesthouses, I bought several properties like this for guest accommodations. During the three years of lockdown, I had to resell the villas, but the process of selling was very difficult."
This year, as outbound tourism began to recover, Niu Niu gradually saw hope. "My colleagues also started to see hope and have renovated their guesthouses."

However, with frequent safety issues in Southeast Asian tourism and the release of several "anti-fraud" movies this year, travelers' enthusiasm for traveling to Southeast Asia has diminished, adding to their cautious attitude.

In the beginning of this year, two movies, "The Disappeared Her" and "All or Nothing," were set in Southeast Asia and gained popularity. In May, a tragic incident involving a couple in Bali, India further deepened tourists' concerns about safety in Southeast Asia. The combination of these movies and real-life events has become a "deterrent guide" for traveling to Southeast Asia.

Niu Niu told Xiaoguangshe, "Since the reopening of outbound tourism, the recovery rate has been slower than expected. By the time summer vacation arrived, many of my colleagues felt that if the situation did not improve during the summer, it would be really difficult. So, starting from June, many businesses, guesthouses, and travel agencies started offering heavily discounted prices to attract Chinese tourists."
However, simply reducing prices may not dispel the concerns of Chinese tourists. In the first half of this year, China dropped out of Thailand's largest source of tourists. According to data released by the Ministry of Tourism and Sports of Thailand in August, from January to July of this year, there were only 1.83 million Chinese tourists visiting Thailand, compared to 11 million in the same period before the pandemic in 2019, accounting for only one-fourth of the total international tourists received by Thailand that year.

Thailand still receives tourists, but the number of Chinese tourists has indeed decreased significantly. A netizen who traveled to Thailand before the visa exemption policy mentioned, "It's obvious that there are fewer Chinese people. When we went through the procedures at the airport, there were only me and two other Chinese tourists."
China News Weekly also reported the experience of a traveler who visited Thailand for work in July. The flight from Guangzhou to Phuket had almost one-fourth of the seats empty. After landing, there were hardly any signs of ground handlers waiting for tour groups, which used to be a common sight before the pandemic.
According to the data from the Ministry of Tourism and Sports of Thailand, Malaysia has become the largest source of tourists for Thailand in the first seven months of this year, with approximately 2.43 million visitors. South Korea ranks third with around 900,000 visitors, followed closely by India and Russia.
Although the recovery rate of Chinese tourists in Thailand is not as expected, the China Tourism Research Institute recently released a report stating that Thailand is still the top destination for mainland Chinese tourists, accounting for more than 16% of outbound travelers in the first half of this year.
For those who still choose Thailand as their destination, cost-effectiveness is often the most important factor.
"Just for this Golden Week, the Holiday Inn is only around 500 yuan per night, which is cheaper than Dalian. Considering the cost of going abroad, it is really good value for money," said Small Huang.

## Is Visa Exemption the Ultimate Solution?

Starting from the Golden Week holiday, Thailand's visa exemption policy specifically targeted Chinese tourists. In fact, in early September, several Thai media outlets reported that the newly appointed Prime Minister, Saita, mentioned plans to promote visa exemptions for Chinese tourists, with the official implementation date set for October 1. The policy was quickly implemented after the news circulated for half a month.

Prior to this, Thailand had already introduced a series of visa preferential policies for Chinese tourists, mostly related to waiving visa fees. However, this time, the policy went further by eliminating the entire visa application process, including visa on arrival, and any associated fees.

Previously, the visa on arrival process required queuing for more than three hours, and the visa options included applying for an electronic visa for 240 yuan, allowing a stay of 60 days, or opting for a visa on arrival for 2,000 Thai baht, equivalent to approximately 410 yuan, allowing a stay of 15 days. Starting from August, Thailand gradually lowered the threshold for visa procedures, and by the end of September, the entire process was eliminated.

In addition to the visa exemption, the Thai Prime Minister's Office spokesperson, Gaisacharong, announced during a press conference that China is one of the main target markets for Thailand's tourism industry. As a result, Thailand plans to launch special tourism promotion activities targeting Chinese tourists and establish a dedicated team to explain any negative news related to Thailand on the internet to Chinese tourists.
To attract Chinese tourists, Thailand's visa exemption is not an isolated case. South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism announced a plan on September 4 to attract Chinese tourists, including waiving the e-visa processing fee for travel to South Korea and simplifying the shopping tax refund process. They aim to attract 2 million Chinese tourists by the end of this year. On September 11, the Prime Minister of Georgia, a country located at the intersection of Europe and Asia, announced that Georgia would grant visa exemption to Chinese citizens. On September 12, the China Tourism Academy announced that 268 travel agencies would be allowed to provide visa-free services for Chinese citizens traveling to Russia under a specific agreement between the Chinese and Russian governments. Furthermore, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Ryabkov, stated that Russia does not rule out the possibility of completely canceling visa requirements for Chinese citizens in the future.
While visa exemptions improve the travel experience and reduce costs for outbound tourists, they are only a temporary measure. To achieve sustainable growth in tourism, it is crucial to continuously enhance travel safety, improve services, and enhance the overall travel experience.

## Conclusion

The introduction of the visa exemption policy has rekindled Chinese tourists' interest in traveling to Thailand. However, the recovery of Thailand's tourism market still faces challenges such as safety concerns and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the visa exemption policy has been effective in attracting Chinese tourists, it is essential for Thailand to focus on dispelling safety concerns and promoting a safe and enjoyable travel experience to fully regain its popularity among Chinese tourists. By offering high-quality services and optimizing the overall travel experience, Thailand has the potential to become a top destination for Chinese travelers once again.
