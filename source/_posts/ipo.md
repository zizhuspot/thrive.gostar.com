Shanghai, known as the financial and technological hub of China, has emerged as a powerhouse in the chip industry. With over 1,000 chip and semiconductor companies, Shanghai accounts for 40% of such enterprises in the country. This article delves into the rise of Shanghai's chip industry, exploring the success of companies like Jita Semiconductor and the vibrant ecosystem that supports their growth.

## Shanghai's Flourishing Chip Industry

Shanghai's chip industry has been thriving in recent years, driven by the urgent need to develop indigenous semiconductor technology due to export restrictions imposed by the United States. Jita Semiconductor, founded in 2017, is one of the leading players in this landscape. The company specializes in the research, development, and production of semiconductor integrated circuit chips, catering to the automotive electronics, industrial control, and high-end consumer electronics sectors.
Jita Semiconductor has garnered significant attention and investment, with its recent funding round raising a staggering 13.5 billion Chinese yuan. While the specific investors have not been disclosed, notable participants include Kunshan Capital, which contributed around 120 million yuan.
The appeal of Jita Semiconductor stems from its focus on cutting-edge chip manufacturing processes. The company offers a range of core chip technologies and services, including microcontrollers, analog circuits, power devices, and sensors. As a pioneer in the production of automotive electronic chips and IGBT chips, Jita Semiconductor has positioned itself as a key player in China's chip industry.

## The Journey of Jita Semiconductor

Jita Semiconductor's journey began in 2017 when China Electronics Corporation and the Shanghai Municipal Government signed a strategic cooperation agreement to establish a state-owned integrated circuit project. With a total investment of 35.9 billion yuan, the project aimed to build an 8-inch production line with a monthly capacity of 60,000 wafers and a 12-inch advanced technology production line with a capacity of 50,000 wafers. To oversee this project, Huada Semiconductor, a subsidiary of China Electronics Corporation, established Jita Semiconductor.

Huada Semiconductor, founded in May 2014, is one of China's top ten integrated circuit design companies. The company holds a significant market share in the fields of analog circuits, LCD drivers, smart cards, and security chips. In terms of smart card and security chip shipments and revenue, Huada Semiconductor ranks first in China and among the top five globally.
In August 2018, Jita Semiconductor's advanced technology production line commenced operations in Shanghai Lingang. In the same month, Jita Semiconductor signed a merger agreement with Shanghai Advanced Semiconductor, a leading analog chip foundry in China. This strategic move enabled Jita Semiconductor to absorb and privatize Shanghai Advanced Semiconductor, which boasted 5-inch, 6-inch, and 8-inch wafer production lines. The company focused on manufacturing analog circuits and power devices, with an annual production capacity of 628,000 8-inch equivalent wafers. It was one of the earliest companies in China to engage in the production of automotive electronic chips and IGBT chips.

The merger with Shanghai Advanced Semiconductor, combined with the support of its parent company Huada Semiconductor, propelled Jita Semiconductor's rapid growth. The company now operates two manufacturing facilities in Shanghai's Free Trade Zone Lingang New Area and Xuhui District, with a total built and planned capacity of 280,000 wafers per month (8-inch equivalent). This includes 70,000 wafers per month of 6-inch, 110,000 wafers per month of 8-inch, 50,000 wafers per month of 12-inch, and 30,000 wafers per month of silicon carbide.

## A Stellar Team and Strategic Collaborations

Jita Semiconductor's success can be attributed not only to its advantageous position within the Shanghai chip industry but also to its exceptional team and strategic collaborations. In 2022, Zhang Ruijing, a prominent figure in the Chinese semiconductor industry, joined Jita Semiconductor as an executive director. With his extensive experience and expertise, Zhang Ruijing has contributed advanced chip development technology and management strategies to Jita Semiconductor. He previously founded important enterprises in the semiconductor field, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), XMC, and Chingis Technology.

Recognizing the pressing need for chip supply in the new energy vehicle industry, Zhang Ruijing's involvement with Jita Semiconductor aims to address the chip shortage and reduce dependence on imports. By attracting top talent and fostering a culture of innovation, Jita Semiconductor has established itself as a leader in the field.

Moreover, Jita Semiconductor has engaged in strategic collaborations to further enhance its capabilities. In January 2022, the company signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Geely Technology Group, a prominent automotive technology company. This partnership focuses on collaborative research and development, manufacturing, market applications, and talent development in the field of automotive-grade chips. Together, they aim to drive the co-development of the automotive-grade chip industry, foster breakthroughs in domestic semiconductor technology, and establish a mature and stable automotive semiconductor industry ecosystem.

In April 2022, Jita Semiconductor entered into a strategic partnership with Huada Jiutian. As part of this collaboration, Huada Jiutian joined the Lingang Automotive-Grade Semiconductor Innovation Alliance, led by Jita Semiconductor. The partnership aims to leverage technological synergies, accelerate the deployment of Foundry EDA tools, and expedite the adaptation of manufacturing lines.

## Shanghai: The Silicon Valley of China

Shanghai's dominance in the chip industry extends beyond Jita Semiconductor. The city boasts numerous chip industry unicorns, with an estimated valuation of around 225 billion yuan. These unicorns include companies like Ziguang Zhanrui, MoorThread, Muxi Integrated, Tianshu Zhixin, and Hesai Technology, among others.
Ziguang Zhanrui is a world-leading platform chip design company, specializing in comprehensive communication technologies such as 2G/3G/4G/5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, TV frequency modulation, and satellite communication. In the core 5G field, Ziguang Zhanrui is one of the three publicly listed 5G chip companies globally.
MoorThread, on the other hand, focuses on GPU chip design and provides powerful computing acceleration capabilities for various technology ecosystems. Founded in 2020, the company has already completed multiple funding rounds, with notable investors including NVIDIA's former Vice President and China General Manager, Zhang Jianzhong.
Muxi Integrated, another rising star, was founded in 2020 and is dedicated to providing comprehensive GPU chips and solutions for heterogeneous computing. Their products find applications in artificial intelligence, smart cities, data centers, cloud computing, autonomous driving, digital twinning, and metaverse, supporting the development of the digital economy.
